# Mjolnir

[Mjolnir](http://mjolnir.io/) is the successor to Hyra for window management on a Mac.  
This directory contains my custom files for how I want to do window management.  
So far it's just my port of the old [ShiftIt](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt) window manager functionality.

## Installation

1. Install Mjolnir (see repo for instructions)
2. Symlink `init.lua` into `~/.mjolnir`

Done.
